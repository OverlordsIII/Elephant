            <h1>About Elephant</h1>
            <p>Elephant was designed to help people in school learn and memorize quicker. School tests students based on their ability to regurgitate information, and trying to memorize information on the day it was told to you is like tying to fill a colander with water. This is where Elephant comes in.</p>
            <p>Elephant was designed by a fellow student, who faces the same hardships in school that anyone and everyone else faces. This student created a modern flashcard system with more features to allow more usage.</p>
            <p>Understandably, some may use other products similar to this, such as Quizlet. However, almost all of these services have some sort of problem with it. For example:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>These simple flashcards are good when you want to correlate one idea to another, however they become useless when you want to correlate multiple ideas to one topic.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>For example, "What were the 6 Factors of the French Revolution. It becomes inefficient to create 6 cards and name each card as "Cause 1", "Cause 2", "Cause 3", etc. Instead, you should tie multiple ideas to one card.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Using most of them can become a hassle to setup. In the sense that creating a deck takes a long time with clicking to each text box to create a card.</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>To combat this, we have an advanced and easy hotkey system.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Most of them are slow, and they are such a hassle to create flashcards with on account of their speed.</li>
                <li>Most of them haven't received updates that have made learning better, and as such, old methods don't seem to work</li>
                <ul>
                    <li>Elephant continues to receive updates to make your experience as smooth as possible.</li>
                </ul>
                <li>Most of them are incredibly expensive to use for the methods you want. We make most of our features free for all of our users!</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Elephant combats all of these problems and allows you to create as many decks as you want tailored to whatever you are learning! With this service, learning becomes as collecting water in a glass.</p>
            <p>We are also incredibly open to feedback, unlike many other services. We want to make your learning experience feel like learning addition all over again... easy. To do that, we listen to the community and update our product to reflect your needs.</p>
